# Security Cleanup Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Actions

Your project has been successfully cleaned of all sensitive data and is now ready for GitHub. Here's what was done:

### 1. Created .gitignore File
- Comprehensive .gitignore file created to prevent sensitive files from being committed
- Includes patterns for credentials, environment files, API keys, and other sensitive data

### 2. Removed Sensitive Credential Files
**Deleted files:**
- `Email_Credentials.json` - Contained OAuth2 credentials for email
- `credential.json` - Contained Google Service Account credentials
- `hospital_cred.json` - Contained OAuth2 client credentials
- `dietReq2.json` - Contained diet request email credentials
- `generate-diet-oauth-token.js` - OAuth token generator (no longer needed)
- `generate-hospital-oauth.js` - OAuth token generator (no longer needed)

### 3. Cleaned Environment Variables
**Updated `.env` file:**
- Replaced all actual API keys, tokens, and credentials with placeholder values
- Removed hardcoded Google Sheets spreadsheet ID
- Removed actual OAuth2 credentials
- Removed actual Gemini API key
- Added security warnings and setup instructions

**Created `.env.example`:**
- Template file showing required environment variables
- Contains only placeholder values
- Safe to commit to version control

### 4. Fixed Hardcoded Values in Code
**Updated `gemini-service.js`:**
- Removed hardcoded API key: `AIzaSyCd18IyJh0Yq8g7l_iuk2D-dPkzQQ5y2S8`
- Now uses environment variable with proper error handling

**Updated `config.js`:**
- Removed hardcoded username/password
- Now uses environment variables with fallback values

**Updated `server.js`:**
- Removed hardcoded Google Sheets spreadsheet ID
- Removed fallback to local credential files
- Now requires all credentials via environment variables
- Added proper error messages directing to setup documentation

### 5. Created Documentation
**Created `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md`:**
- Comprehensive guide for setting up environment variables
- Step-by-step instructions for each service (Google Sheets, Gemini AI, Email)
- Security best practices
- Troubleshooting guide

## üîí Security Improvements

1. **No Hardcoded Credentials**: All sensitive data now comes from environment variables
2. **Proper Error Handling**: Clear error messages when credentials are missing
3. **Documentation**: Complete setup guide for new developers
4. **Git Protection**: Comprehensive .gitignore prevents accidental commits

## üìã Next Steps for You

### Before Pushing to GitHub:
1. **Verify .env is not committed**: Check that your `.env` file is listed in `.gitignore`
2. **Test locally**: Ensure your local copy still works with the environment variables
3. **Review files**: Do a final check that no sensitive data remains

### For Production Deployment:
1. Set all environment variables in your hosting platform (Render, Heroku, etc.)
2. Use the values from your original credential files
3. Follow the `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` guide

### For New Team Members:
1. Share the `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` guide
2. Provide them with the actual credential values separately (not via GitHub)
3. Have them copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in real values

## üö® Important Reminders

- **Never commit the `.env` file** - it's in .gitignore for a reason
- **Share credentials securely** - use secure channels, not GitHub
- **Rotate credentials periodically** - especially if they were previously exposed
- **Monitor access logs** - check for any unauthorized access to your services

## üìÅ Files Safe to Commit

‚úÖ All files are now safe to commit to GitHub, including:
- `.gitignore`
- `.env.example`
- `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md`
- All JavaScript files (credentials removed)
- `config.js` (hardcoded values removed)
- All other project files

## üîß Environment Variables Required

Your `.env` file should contain:
- `NODE_ENV`
- `PORT`
- `SPREADSHEET_ID`
- `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS`
- `API` (Gemini API key)
- `EMAIL_CREDENTIALS`
- `DIET_EMAIL_CREDENTIALS`
- `AUTH_USERNAME`
- `AUTH_PASSWORD`

Refer to `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` for detailed setup instructions.
